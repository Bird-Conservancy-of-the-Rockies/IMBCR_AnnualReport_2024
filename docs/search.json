Within many sections, an “On this page” menu of links will appear on the right. This menu may collapse when content extends across the page, but you can click on the collapsed label to access the navigation links.\n\n\nQuick start guide - viewing the results\n\nSurvey locations, species observations, density, occupancy, and population trend\nVisit the brand-new Rocky Mountain Avian Data Center 2.0 (RMADC)! Here you’ll find interactive maps illustrating survey and detection locations, and tables displaying species counts and population estimates (i.e., density, occupancy, and population trend).\nUse the “Explore the Data” tab on the RMADC to filter data by geographic region, year, and species.\nTo navigate the filters, it’s helpful to use this report to determine the “Stratum” or “Superstratum” relevant to you. Click on the relevant agency or geographic region on the sidebar on the left side of this page, then use the “On this page” menu to choose a management unit. The relevant Stratum or Superstratum will be will be listed there.\nNeed some help?\nPlease contact Jennifer Timmer if you have any questions about accessing or interpreting IMBCR results.\n\nPlease note that not every stratum or conceivable combination of strata is summarized in this report. However, all individual strata and all biologically meaningful combinations of strata, or “superstrata”, can be found on the RMADC.\nInstructions for using the RMADC are included in Appendix A of this report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Feature - Conservation & Management\n\n\n\nIn Special Feature - Conservation & Management we highlight two examples of IMBCR trends for managers and decision-makers to monitor both priority species of concern and common species in decline by accessing data via our new Rocky Mountain Avian Data Center.\n\n\nBird Conservancy of the Rockies\n14500 Lark Bunting Lane\nBrighton, CO 80603\n303-659-4348\nwww.birdconservancy.org",

The IMBCR program allows for different stratification schemes across states and regions and the re-stratification of local management units to better address partner management objectives or new questions. The flexible hierarchical design also accommodates annual fluctuation of sampling intensity without compromising regional population estimates. In addition, overlay projects can address specific management questions or hypotheses without affecting the integrity of the overall IMBCR framework.",

    "text": "Using IMBCR Trends to Assess the Status of Species across Scales\nBird populations in North America have declined precipitously over the last 50 years (Rosenberg et al. 2019). Monitoring the status of both species of concern and formerly common but declining species is thus an important objective for management agencies. However, while national trends can help inform broad priorities and sound the alarm on range-wide declines, management typically occurs locally and regionally.\nThe IMBCR program has now collected avian occurrence and density data throughout the western United States for up to 17 years in some regions. These data enable the program to provide critical trend information on bird populations at multiple scales, from individual management units to state or region-wide. Below, we highlight two examples of these data for managers and decision-makers to monitor both existing priority species and common species in decline by accessing data via our recently updated Rocky Mountain Avian Data Center (RMADC).\nThe Savannah Sparrow is not currently a priority species for conservation throughout its wide distribution (Wheelwright and Rising 2020). However, IMBCR trends show a decline across several populations within the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, from larger regions, like statewide across Colorado to specific management units, such as Yellowstone National Park. Given widespread declines at local and larger scales, efforts to prioritize the Savannah Sparrow may be warranted, at least in the western portion of the species’ range.\nThe Evening Grosbeak is a forest specialist and a Road to Recovery tipping point species that has experienced long term population declines (https://r2rbirds.org/tipping-point-species/). However, IMBCR data show variation in population trends throughout the Rockies. For example, populations in some USFS units, like Kootenai National Forest, have experienced declines, while populations in other units, like Helena National Forest, have increased since 2009. Monitoring populations at both local and regional scales can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of how local and regional processes may interact and affect populations, such as the Evening Grosbeak (Hewitt et al. 2007, Pavlacky et al. 2017).\nVisit the Rocky Mountain Avian Data Center (https://apps.birdconservancy.org/rmadc/) to view trends for species of interest in your management area (click on “Explore the Data” to select filters of interest). IMBCR estimates are available for numerous focal areas or “strata”, where partners have invested in monitoring, such as the Bighorn National Forest in Wyoming. The “Superstratum” filter is helpful to find trends for broader regions or statewide (e.g., the BCR18-portion of Colorado) that provide context for strata. Filter trends by f-value &gt;0.9 to view only robust estimates; these estimates are highlighted in yellow and estimates with a more stringent threshold of f &gt;0.975 are shown in gold. Increasing trends are highlighted in blue, while decreasing trends are shown in red. Please note, we now provide two trend metrics: trend based on the annual density estimates and trend based on occupancy estimates. Although density and occupancy have different units, trend on either is interpreted the same way: as the percent population change per year during the monitoring period. Visit the “Tutorial” page for additional information on using the site and interpreting the estimates.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The availability of consistent monitoring data at multiple scales is an important challenge for avian conservation (Ruth et al., 2003). The IMBCR program meets this challenge through its probabilistic, nested design, which allows for inference to multiple scales of interest, from National Grasslands to states to BCRs (Pavlacky et al., 2017). With this design, we can model habitat relationships to evaluate species’ responses to local management actions and predict species’ distributions for landscape prioritization. Stratification based on eco-regional boundaries and other fixed attributes is also a critical feature of the IMBCR program because it allows for the evaluation of long-term avian responses to landscape and climate change (Metzger et al., 2013; Pavlacky et al., 2017).\nThe importance of long-term population monitoring at larger spatial scales is well known (Jones, 2011; Thompson et al., 1998), but it is often cost-prohibitive. The IMBCR program reduces expenses through cooperation with multiple partners, one of the stated goals of effective collaboration and coordinated bird monitoring (NABCI Monitoring Subcommittee, 2007), and also through efficiencies in data collection and analyses. Partners can investigate priority species and management questions with slight modifications to the IMBCR design, further reducing costs associated with developing new studies and monitoring programs. These cost savings allow for an increased sampling effort and/or for the development of decision support tools to aid land managers and conservation practitioners on the ground. Based on the spatially balanced design, the IMBCR program can also accommodate a shortage of monitoring funds in certain years or strata without reducing the overall rigor of the program (Stevens Jr. & Olsen, 2004).\nThe IMBCR program is well-positioned to address the conservation and management needs of a wide range of stakeholders due to its rigorous, hierarchical design and the strength of the IMBCR partnership. This partnership is an ongoing collaboration between multiple entities from state and federal agencies to non-governmental organizations and Joint Ventures, and was created to address management and conservation objectives of larger avian programs like NABCI (NABCI Monitoring Subcommittee, 2007). Through the IMBCR partnership, monitoring resources are pooled, creating efficiencies and allowing for inference to larger landscapes (Pavlacky et al., 2017). By providing essential knowledge of bird populations at multiple scales relevant to management and conservation, the IMBCR program informs prioritization of management actions and facilitates a collaborative approach to bird conservation (Ruth et al., 2003, Pavlacky et al., 2017).",

    "text": "Selecting filters\nThe Rocky Mountain Avian Data Center has been designed to provide information for specific regions and species, and therefore works best when users select multiple filters for a query.\nFor example, to view IMBCR results for Brewer’s sparrow in Colorado, you would select the following filters: Species = Brewer’s Sparrow and State = Colorado). Below is an explanation of the different filter types you may choose from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo navigate the filters, it’s helpful to use this report to determine the Stratum or Superstratum relevant to you. Click on the relevant agency or geographic region on the sidebar on the left side of this page, then use the “On this page” menu to choose a management unit. The relevant Stratum or Superstratum will be listed in a callout block like this one.\n\n\n\nGeographic filters\nBird Conservation Region: Selecting this filter will provide you with results for all strata and superstrata within a particular Bird Conservation Region - see Figure 5.1 for a map.\nState: Selecting this filter will supply the user with data and results for all strata and superstrata within a particular state.\nLand Management Agency: This filter will allow users to select data and results for All Other Lands, Colorado State Land Board, The Nature Conservancy (TNC), US Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), US Bureau of Land Management (BLM), US Department of Defense (DOD), US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), US Forest Service (USFS), or National Park Service (NPS).\nStratum (eg, management unit): This filter allows users to select data and results for a geographic unit of analysis, often an individual management unit.\nSuperstratum (eg, region): This filter allows users to select data and results for multiple strata that were analyzed jointly. Superstrata often represent regions or entire states (e.g., the state of Colorado is split into 30 individual strata), but sometimes management units are stratified by management features and analyzed as a superstratum (e.g., Bridger-Teton National Forest is split into two strata reflecting roadless and roaded areas).\n\n\nOther filters\nSpecies: This filter allows users to select data and results for a particular or group species.\nYear: This filter will allow users to select all data and results for a particular year.",

    "text": "Viewing Density, Occupancy and Trend Results (Density, Occupancy, and Trend Estimates Tabs)\nViewing Tables\nYou may view density, occupancy or trend results tables for all appropriate strata (based on the selected filters) for which we have results, by clicking on the tabs above the map labeled “Density”, “Occupancy” or “Trend Estimates”.\nThe occupancy tables display species, stratum name, year, occupancy (probability that sampling plots are occupied by at least 1 individual of a species), number of surveyed points the species was detected on, and the percent coefficient of variation (% CV, an indicator of reliability for density or occupancy). The density tables display species, stratum name, year, number of birds estimated per km² (D) within the stratum, percent coefficient of variation (% CV), and the number of independent detections used in analyses (n). We classify density and occupancy estimates as “robust” if the CV is &lt; 50% (these records will be highlighted in gold in the tables).\nThe trend tables display the stratum name, species, years (i.e., the monitoring period), and then two sets of trend estimates: trend based on the annual density estimates and trend based on the annual occupancy estimates. Trend for density and occupancy is interpreted as the percent change per year of the monitoring period. The “f” value for both trends is the probability that the trend is in the direction of the reported % change. For example, if a trend estimate is 5.5 and the f value is 0.95, this means the population has increased 5.5% each year of the monitoring period and we are 95% certain the population has increased. Robust trends have an f value &gt; 0.9 and these records are highlighted in yellow in the trend tables. Some partners prefer to use a more stringent cut-off of f &gt; 0.975, and these records are highlighted in gold. The 95% CI is the 95% credible interval, which contains the true population trend with 95% certainty. 95% CIs which do not overlap zero are equivalent to f &gt; 0.975. Note that trend estimates with an f value between 0.9-0.975, although robust, will have 95% CIs that overlap 0. This is because f &gt; 0.9 is equivalent to an 80% CI that does not overlap 0.\nStratum and Superstratum Results\nDensity, occupancy, and trend estimates will always be displayed by individual strata in the top table and by superstrata that the individual strata contribute to in the bottom table. If you use the “Stratum” filter to select an individual management unit, estimates for all relevant superstrata will be included in the table below for regional context. If you use the “Superstratum” filter to select a region or state, estimates for all individual strata contained within that superstratum will be included in the top table. This provides automatic context for local populations with regional populations. For example, use the Stratum filter to select WY-BCR10-BI: Bighorn National Forest, and the top table will show estimates for Bighorn National Forest. The bottom table will show estimates for3 main superstrata: statewide in Wyoming, the BCR10-portion of WY, and USFS-Region 2 National Forests.\nDownload results of your query\nYou may easily download the results of your query as a CSV file by clicking the Download button below each table.\nViewing the Density Charts\nWhen viewing the density charts, the point estimate of density for a given year is indicated with a circle, and the error bars represent the 95% credible interval. We will include occupancy charts in future RMADC updates.",

The “NPS Rocky Mountain Inventory and Monitoring Network (RMNW)” and “Northern Colorado Plateau Inventory and Monitoring Network (NCPN)” were re-stratified because some NCPN park units were initially misclassified into the RMNW stratum. In Wyoming, the USFS Region 4 stratum was re-stratified into three separate strata: “Bridger-Teton National Forest front-country/managed areas”, “Bridger-Teton National Forest designated roadless/wilderness areas” and “the remainder of USFS Region 4 lands in Wyoming BCR 10”.

Additionally, there were several re-stratifications done in Colorado. The Colorado BCR 10 stratum was split into two strata: BLM Lands and All Other Lands. This was done to facilitate improved tracking of priority species on BLM lands throughout Colorado. Rio Grande National Forest and White River National Forest strata were each split into three strata: low, medium, and high elevations. This stratification by elevation allowed sampling intensity changes to target Management Indicator Species on the forests. The Routt National Forest and Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests strata were reorganized and a third stratum, the Williams Fork Area, was created from the two because it had mixed administration between the Routt National Forest and the Arapahoe and Roosevelt National Forests.\nThe RMNW stratum was re-stratified to accurately reflect land ownership. There was a land acquisition within Great Sand Dunes National Monument and some samples were removed from Rio Grande National Forest and added to the RMNW stratum; 16 km² were added to the area of the RMNW strata. In South Dakota, the Black Hills National Forest stratum was split into two strata based on watersheds in the Forest: Hydrologic Code 7 Watersheds and all other watersheds. Stratification by watershed allows for adjusting sampling intensity to target Management Indicator Species on the Forest.",

The new strata include “All Other Lands in the Region 1 portion of Idaho BCR 10” (all lands outside of national forest boundaries), “All Other Lands in the Region 4 portion of Idaho BCR 10” (all lands outside of national forest boundaries), “other USFS lands in the Region 1 portion of Idaho BCR 10” and “USFS designated roadless/wilderness areas within the Region 4 portion of Idaho BCR 10”. In Arizona, Tonto National Forest became a part of the IMBCR survey effort. The forest was stratified into two strata based on elevation to allow sampling intensity changes to target Management Indicator Species on the Forests. Kaibab National Forest was re-stratified into two strata based on elevation for the same reason. In Montana, several strata were re-stratified and combined within BCR 17. The three “All Other Lands” strata were combined with the “Tribal Lands” stratum into one “All Other Lands” stratum. The four BLM strata within Montana BCR 17 were combined into one BLM stratum. These strata were collapsed into larger strata to maximize the number of samples conducted within two strata rather than spread them out amongst eight strata.",

    "text": "2013\n2013 brought significant changes to the program’s overall stratification methods. The original IMBCR sampling grids were created at the state scale and as the program expanded, additional sampling grids were created at the BCR scale. In response to a rapidly growing monitoring program, the partnership acknowledged the need for a standard national grid system to promote the coordination and application of monitoring data in conservation. The group proposed the use of the United States National Grid (USNG), a national grid system created by the Federal Geographic Data Committee, as its standard. There are three advantages to using the USNG. First, the use of standard grids allows for the integration of datasets and subsequent identification of areas where sampling should or has not occurred. Second, it provides a means to identify sampled areas in a consistent manner so results of monitoring projects can be evaluated in a spatially comparable way. Lastly, it facilitates regional and national-level avian distribution modeling and the development of broad-scale avian distribution maps. This standard was approved by the NABCI committee. Bird Conservancy started using the USNG for new stratification and re-stratification schemes in 2013.\nWe added several USFS strata to the sampling frame for the 2013 field season – Coronado National Forest in southern Arizona, Carson National Forest in north-central New Mexico, and Caribou-Targhee National Forest in southeastern Idaho. Coronado and Carson National Forests were stratified into two strata based on elevation to allow for adjusting sampling intensity to target Management Indicator Species on the Forests. Because Caribou-Targhee National Forest spans three states and three BCRs, it was necessary to divide the forest into four strata. The state and BCR-level stratification distinctions allowed the summation of the data for individual states or BCRs. The four new strata in Idaho and Utah join a preexisting Caribou-Targhee stratum in west-central Wyoming as a part of Wyoming’s statewide effort. In addition, Pawnee National Grassland was split into two strata – public lands and private lands – since Pawnee National Grassland contains a large amount of private land within its administrative boundary. This allowed the USFS to concentrate more survey effort specifically on public lands. In Wyoming, the preexisting stratum in BCR 10 containing all USFS Region 4 lands (other than Bridger-Teton National Forest) was re-stratified into three separate strata, one for each Forest (Caribou-Targhee, Ashley, and Wasatch). This allows for forest-wide estimates within Caribou-Targhee National Forest. If, in the future, Ashley and Wasatch National Forests are completely sampled, this will also allow for forest-wide estimates in each of those forests.\nThe North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska portions of BCR 17 underwent a complete re-stratification to incorporate several NPS Northern Great Plains Inventory and Monitoring Network (NGPN) strata. All of the non-NPS strata in these states were retained, but renamed to avoid confusion. The NPS strata were stratified by NPS unit to allow the NGPN to monitor birds on each of its units separately. New strata included Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site, Theodore Roosevelt National Park, Badlands National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, Mount Rushmore National Monument, and Wind Cave National Park.\nNebraska BCR 18 also underwent a complete re-stratification to allow for the individual stratification of Agate Fossil Beds and Scotts Bluff National Monuments. We also added an additional stratum for Cherry Ranch, a property owned by The Nature Conservancy (TNC).",

The control portion of the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests consists of lands ranging in elevation from 6,000 ft. (1,829 m) to 9,000 ft. (2,743 m) and excludes treatment areas and areas burned between 1998 and 2013. The Pike and San Isabel control stratum ranges from 6,000 ft. (1,829 m) to 9,500 ft. (2,896 m) and excludes treatment areas and areas burned between 1998 and 2013. We created a single experiment overlay stratum for all of Arapaho and Roosevelt and Pike and San Isabel National Forests consisting of actual treatment areas (areas with &gt;30% treatment). Since this stratum spans multiple forests, it is not considered to be a part of the IMBCR design; however, detections from this stratum do contribute to the number of detections used in analyses.\nSignificant stratification changes were made to the BCR 10 portion of Idaho. The four strata defined in the 2012 field season were further subdivided into nine strata. The boundary between USFS Regions 1 and 4 runs through Idaho and was taken into account when re-stratifying so that estimates could be generated at the USFS Region level. The new strata created in Idaho BCR 10 include the “Idaho portion of Bitterroot National Forest”, “BLM Lands within Idaho BCR10”, “Boise National Forest”, “the Idaho portion of Kootenai National Forest”, “Payette National Forest”, “Salmon-Challis National Forest”, “Sawtooth National Forest”, “All other Lands within Idaho BCR 10 and USFS Region 1” (all lands outside of national forest and BLM boundaries) and “All Other Lands within Idaho BCR 10 and USFS Region 4” (all lands outside of national forest and BLM boundaries). Since Bitterroot and Kootenai National Forests span Idaho and Montana, 2014 density and occupancy estimates for those forests included strata from both states. In the past, “forest-wide” estimates have only represented the Montana portion of these forests.\nWe subdivided the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) strata in Montana BCRs 11 and 17 to allow density and occupancy estimation specifically within the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge. Previously, we grouped all USFWS lands together in these BCRs, limiting estimates for individual refuges. In each BCR, we created two new strata – a Charles M. Russel NWR stratum and an “All Other USFWS Lands” stratum.\nIn addition to re-stratification, we added a few new strata to the IMBCR program in 2014. In Nebraska, NGPN began monitoring on the Niobrara National Scenic River spanning BCRs 17 and 19. In Utah, we created a new stratum for Manti-La Sal National Forest. Previously, only the Colorado portion of Manti-La Sal was stratified and surveyed. The additional Utah portion allows for the generation of forest-wide estimates for Manti-La Sal.",

    "text": "2015\nIn 2015, the Department of Defense (DoD) stratum in Colorado BCR 18 was completely re-stratified as part of a DoD Legacy Resource Management Program Grant to represent six individual military installations: US Air Force Academy, Fort Carson, Pueblo Chemical Depot, Piñon Canyon, and All Other DoD Lands. This DoD installation-level stratification allows for the generation of density and occupancy estimates for each installation. Fort Carson and Piñon Canyon were further stratified by areas within range fans (training zones) and areas outside of range fans to allow the DoD to assess the effects of military training on bird species.\nThe Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge stratum also came out of the 2015 re-stratification. During WWII, the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, as it was originally known, was a chemical weapons manufacturing facility. At the time of the 2008 IMBCR stratification in the state Colorado, it was still partially owned by the US Army and was included in the DoD stratum. The refuge is now in its own individual stratum.\nThe IMBCR program expanded to include the Missouri National Recreational River (MNRR), part of the NPS NGPN in Nebraska and South Dakota. There are two strata for MNRR representing the 39 Mile District and the 59 Mile District. In Utah, an additional stratum was added for Sanpitch Recreation Area. This area is part of Uinta National Forest but administered by Manti-La Sal National Forest and will be incorporated into forest-wide estimates for Manti-La Sal National.",

    "text": "2016\nIn 2016, the Playa Lakes Joint Venture (PLJV) coordinated a partnership between several state wildlife agencies and Bird Conservancy to expand sampling in five of the joint venture’s six states: Nebraska, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. PLJV’s sixth state, Colorado, was already included in the IMBCR program starting in 2008. This expansion now provides the program with nearly complete coverage of two BCRs that were only sparsely covered in past years: Shortgrass Prairie (BCR 18) and Central Mixed Grass Prairie (BCR 19). The BCR 18 and 19 portions of these 5 states were divided into several strata, including, playas, rivers, biologically unique landscapes in Nebraska, and all other lands.\nThe IMBCR program also underwent a major expansion into the state of Utah in 2016. The entire state was stratified into BLM, USFS, DoD, and All Other Lands strata. This year was somewhat of a pilot year, with select BLM, USFS, DoD, and all other lands strata sampled across the state. In future years, sampling will be increased to a statewide level.\nIn addition to new strata, some existing strata were re-stratified for a variety of reasons. In North and South Dakota, we re-stratified the Tribal and All Other Lands strata to ensure all tribal lands were only included in the tribal lands strata. In the past, some tribal lands could still be found within the All Other Lands strata. We also re-stratified Cimarron, Kiowa, and Rita Blanca National Grasslands in Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. With the expansion of IMBCR throughout the PLJV region, these strata needed to be fit to the US National Grid to make them consistent with the rest of the IMBCR program in the region. In addition, we determined that the portion of Rita Blanca National Grassland that fell in New Mexico was actually managed by Kiowa National Grassland, so that portion was moved to the Kiowa National Grasslands stratum. All DoD lands in Colorado BCR18 were combined into one stratum. This was the same stratification used prior to 2015.",

In Idaho, BLM Four Rivers Field Office in BCR 9 was split into two strata, incorporating the boundaries of Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area into the design.

    "text": "2010\nBeginning in 2010, the point count duration was increased from five minutes to six minutes to facilitate occupancy estimation, which is easier to analyze using equal time intervals (in this case, two minutes each). Observers began recording juvenile birds detected during point counts. Observers placed a “J” in the sex column for these detections. Previously, juvenile birds were not recorded because this study focuses on recording breeding birds. Juvenile bird detections are used for distribution mapping purposes only and are not factored into data analysis. A minute column was added to the bird datasheet so observers could record the actual minute of each bird detection during a point count. Previously, observers used tick marks to separate minute intervals. We added a “visual” checkbox to the bird datasheet for observers to check if they visually observed and identified any of the species recorded. This reminds observers that they need to look for birds in addition to listening for them and helps crew leaders make decisions regarding unusual or rare bird detections while proofing data. We provided observers with an additional datasheet to record the reasons points were not surveyed (e.g., weather issues, unsafe terrain, denied permission by landowner, etc.). This sheet also provided space to record additional landowner information as needed. Lastly, observers began recording horizontal distance to each flyover detection. In the past, we did not record distances because we do not use flyover detections in analysis. However, observers sometimes incorrectly distinguish flyovers from birds using the surrounding habitat while foraging on the wing (e.g., swallows, swifts, and raptors). Therefore, if we find an incorrectly recorded flyover, we can still use the detection data in analysis.",

    "text": "2012\nIn 2012, observers began recording the start time for every point count conducted so we could use temporal information as a variable in analyses. Start times for the entire transect and for individual points were all recorded in Mountain Daylight Time for consistency across the region. Prior to 2012, observers were allowed to conduct point counts until 11:00 AM local time each day. In order to account for variability across study areas from Arizona to Montana, crew leaders instructed observers to survey no later than five hours after sunrise in 2012. Observers also began noting migrant detections on surveys. After the field season, we thoroughly review the migrant records; if those records are verified, they are not included in analysis. Previously, crew leaders instructed observers to record a bird as a male if 1) it was a singing warbler or sparrow, or 2) it was singing repeatedly and emphatically. In 2012, we instructed observers to only identify the sex of a visually observed bird of a sexually dimorphic species. We instructed observers to record subspecies only if they visually identified a bird as such. In the past, we used geographic range to assume a bird was of a particular subspecies. Up until the 2012 field season, we provided observers with a list of rare or difficult to detect species to record while traveling between points within a sampling unit. In 2012, in order to simplify the protocol and collect more useful information, we eliminated the list and observers recorded any species they came across while traveling between points they had not documented during a point count. That way all species encountered within the sampling unit would be documented for distribution mapping purposes.\nAlso in 2012, several changes were made to the vegetation datasheet. First, we removed distance to the nearest road, forest structural stage and human structures from the data sheet. We no longer collect these types of data in the field because they can be obtained through remote sensing. Second, we modified the datasheet to simply record whether a mid-story was present. In the past, if mid-story vegetation was present, observers would record the species found in that layer. Data analysis found mid-story vegetation data to be extremely variable from year to year. Third, we added a ground cover category for residual grass. Finally, we limited acceptable overstory, understory, and ground cover relative abundance values to 1%, 5%, or increments of 10%. In the past, observers estimated cover to the nearest percent for all categories where percent cover or relative abundance was recorded. We made the change to improve the consistency of cover and relative abundance estimates and to decrease the amount of time observers spend estimating these values.\nIn 2012, crew leaders provided observers with two additional data sheets to facilitate working on private lands. The first contained specific information about the land ownership of each point located within a given sampling unit. In cases where a point fell on private property, the data sheet contained the name, contact information and any pertinent notes about the landowner. The second data sheet was a contact log where observers recorded all contacts or attempted contacts they had with landowners. This information was later entered into the landowner database when the observer had internet access.",

We derive stratum-level density estimates by averaging all \\(D_{ijt}\\) within each stratum, and we take the area-weighted average of strata estimates to obtain superstrata density and occupancy estimates.\n\n\nObservation process\nWe model the sum of observed counts (of independent clusters of individuals) across all points surveyed within a grid cell (\\(n_{ijt}\\)) as\n\\[n_{ijt} \\sim Binomial\\biggl(N_{ijt},p_{[a],tl}×p_{[p]}×\\biggl(\\frac{K_{[s],ijt}}{K}\\biggr)\\biggr), \\tag{D.9}\\]\nwhere \\(p_{[a],tl}\\) is a year- and BCR-specific availability component of detection probability, \\(p_{[p]}\\) is the perceptibility component of detection probability, and \\(K_{[s],ijt}⁄K\\) is survey effort. Detection components can be expressed as the sum of probability vectors:\n\\[p_{[a],tl}=∑_{r=1}^{R} π_{[a],tlr} \\tag{D.10}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[p_{[p]}=∑_{d=1}^{d_{max}} π_{[p],d}, \\tag{D.11}\\]\nwhere \\(π_{[a],tlr}\\) and \\(π_{[p],d}\\) are detection probabilities within time removal and distance bins (hereafter bin probabilities), respectively. We model the distribution of counted individuals among time removal and distance bins, respectively, as\n\\[\\mathbf{y_{[a],ijt}} \\sim Multinomial \\biggl(n_{ijt},\\mathbf{π_{[a],tl}^{[c]}} \\biggr) \\tag{D.12}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\\mathbf{y_{[p],ijt}} \\sim Multinomial \\biggl(n_{ijt},\\mathbf{π_{[p]}^{[c]}} \\biggr), \\tag{D.13}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{y_{[a],ijt}}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y_{[p],ijt}}\\) are vectors of counts within time removal and distance bins. Bin probabilities for availability assume constant availability across the survey period,\n\\[π_{[a],trl}=p_{[ar],tl} (1-p_{[ar],tl})^{r-1}, \\tag{D.14}\\]\nwhere \\(p_{[ar],tl}\\) is the availability for a single 2-min time removal bin. Bin probabilities for perceptibility account for area of bins with increasing distance,\n\\[π_{[p],d}=\\frac{p_{[pd],d}A_d}{∑_{d=1}^{d_{[max]}}A_d},~\\mathrm{and} \\tag{D.15}\\]\nwhere \\(p_{[pd],d}\\) is the perceptibility within distance bin \\(d\\) and \\(A_d\\) is the area of distance bin \\(d\\). Multinomial cell probabilites for modeling \\(\\mathbf{y_{[a],ijt}}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y_{[p],ijt}}\\) represent bin probabilites scaled to sum to 1:\n\\[π_{[a],trl}^{[c]}=π_{[a],trl}⁄p_{[a],tl}, \\tag{D.16}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[π_{[p],d}^{[c]}=π_{[p],d}⁄p_{[p]}. \\tag{D.17}\\]\nSurveys in 2008-2009 were 5 min instead of 6 min in length, so for these years, we calculate the availability for a 1-min interval, \\(p_{[a1],tl}=1-\\biggl((1-p_{[ar],tl})^3\\biggr)^{1/6}\\), and then calculate the unscaled cell probability for the third (1 min) period as \\(π_{[a],(t≤2)(r=3)l}=p_{[a1],tl}×(1-p_{[ar],tl})^{r-1}\\). We model \\(p_{[pd],td}\\) using one of four possible perceptibility models: 1) a half-normal constant model, 2) a hazard rate constant model, 3) a half-normal year model, and 4) a hazard rate year model. For half-normal functions, we calculated \\(p_{[pd],d}\\) for each distance class as:\n\\[p_{[pd],d}=\\frac{2\\pi\\int_{c=d_{[low]}}^{c=d_{[high]}}exp\\biggl(-\\biggl(\\frac{c^2}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\biggr)\\biggr)c~dc}{A_d}, \\tag{D.18}\\]\nwhere \\(d_{[low]}\\) and \\(d_{[high]}\\) are the bounds for distance bin \\(d\\), and \\(σ\\) is the half-normal shape parameter. Because of the lack of an analytical solution to the integral of the hazard rate function, we calculated \\(p_{[pd],td}\\) at the midpoint, \\(d_{[mid]}\\), of each distance class:\n\\[p_{[pd],td}=1-exp\\biggl(-\\biggl(\\frac{d_{[mid]}}{h}\\biggr)^b\\biggr), \\tag{D.19}\\]\nwhere \\(h\\) and \\(b\\) are estimated parameters for the hazard function. For perceptibility models (Equation D.18 and Equation D.19), shape parameters were modeled as constant across space and time. Previously, we had modeled perceptibility shape parameters as variable across years for species with sufficient data. For the sake of computational efficiency and considering distance sampling benefits from pooling robustness (Buckland et al. 2001, 2008), we simplified to constant-perceptibility models starting in 2024. We allowed availability to vary by year and BCR:\n\\[logit(p_{[ar],tl}) \\sim Normal(μ_{[p_{ar}]},SD_{[p_{ar}]}^2). \\tag{D.20}\\]\nPriors for annual variation in availability are\n\\[μ_{[p_{ar}]} \\sim Normal(0,1), \\tag{D.21}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[SD_{[p_{ar}]} \\sim gamma(1,1). \\tag{D.22}\\]\n\n\n\nOccupancy model\nWe describe here the occupancy model, which estimates occupancy of points conditioned on occupancy of grid cells.\n\nState process\nWe model species occupancy of grid cells in the same manner as for the abundance model (Equation D.1, Equation D.2). We model species occupancy of points within an occupied grid cell as\n\\[u_{ijt}|z_{ijt} \\sim Binomial(K,θ_{it}×z_{ijt}) \\tag{D.23}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[logit(θ_{it}) \\sim Normal(μ_{[θ],t},SD_{[θ],t}^{2}), \\tag{D.24}\\]\nwhere \\(θ_{it}\\) is the probability of species occupancy of a point within an occupied grid cell in stratum \\(i\\) and year \\(t\\), \\(u_{ijt}\\) is the latent occupancy state describing the number of points occupied within grid cell \\(j\\), stratum \\(i\\), and year \\(t\\), and \\(μ_{[θ],t}\\) and \\(SD_{[θ],t}^{2}\\) are year-specific mean and variance hyper-parameters.\n\n\nObservation process\nWe model species detections at points using\n\\[y_{ijt} \\sim Binomial\\biggl(u_{ijt},p_{tl}×\\biggl(\\frac{K_{[s],ijt}}{K}\\biggr)\\biggr), \\tag{D.25}\\]\nwith \\(p_{tl}\\) is a year- and BCR-specific detection probability and \\(K_{[s],ijt}⁄K\\) is survey effort. Overall species detectability for a point survey, \\(p_{tl}\\), summarizes the probability vector\n\\[p_{tl}=∑_{r=1}^{R} \\mathbf{π_{[R],tl}^{[c]}} \\tag{D.26}\\]\nconsisting of multinomial cell probabilities for\n\\[\\mathbf{y_{[R],ijt}} \\sim Multinomial \\biggl(y_{ijtl}, \\mathbf{π_{[R],tl}^{[c]}} \\biggr), \\tag{D.27}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{y_{[R],ijt}}\\) is a vector of representing the frequency of points where the species was detected across time removal bins when first detected. Cell probabilities for the time removal model assume constant detectability across the survey period,\n\\[π_{[R],trl}=p_{[R],tl} (1-p_{[R],tl})^{r-1}, \\tag{D.28}\\]\nand are scaled to sum to 1,\n\\[π_{[R],trl}^{[c]}=π_{[R],trl}⁄p_{tl}, \\tag{D.29}\\]\nwhere \\(p_{[R],tl}\\) is species detectability for a single 2-min time removal bin. We model variability in species detectability here (\\(p_{[R],tl}\\)) in the same manner as the availability component of the abundance model (\\(p_{[ar]}\\) in Equation D.20, Equation D.21, and Equation D.22), including the shorter 5-min survey period in 2008-2009 (see explanation following Equation D.16).\n\n\n\nTrend estimation\nWe derived posterior estimates of occupancy and abundance trends for any strata or superstrata for desired time periods from strata or (rolled-up) superstrata estimates of occupancy or density, respectively. For stratum or superstratum \\(i\\) we fitted a generalized linear model (GLM) to each posterior sample, m, of density or occupancy estimates:\n\\[log(\\hat{D}_{itm}) \\sim α_{[D],im}+r_{[D],im}×(t-1)~\\mathrm{or} \\tag{D.30}\\]\n\\[logit(\\hat{ψ}_{itm}×\\hat{θ}_{it}) \\sim α_{[ψθ],im}+r_{[ψθ],im}×(t-1). \\tag{D.31}\\]\nFor occupancy, we multiplied \\(ψ×θ\\) to derive the unconditional probability of a point being occupied by the species, and then derived trends. We retained the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the slope, \\(\\tilde{r}_{im}\\), which is equivalent to the least squares trend. We also retained the MLE of the intercept \\(\\tilde{α}_{im}\\). We then summarized across \\(m\\) to derive the posterior estimates for \\(r\\) and predicted \\(D\\) and \\(ψ×θ\\).\n\n\nPlot size\nFollowing established practice for distance sampling data (Buckland et al. 2001:15, 151), we truncated detections for each species beyond the 90% quantile of recorded distances from the surveyor. The purpose of this practice is to improve the fit of the perceptibility curve by minimizing the influence of outliers on estimation (e.g., \\(p_{[p],tl}\\) in Equation D.11). The plot size for abundance estimation technically corresponds with truncation distance, but because density is abundance scaled by area, interpretation of density does not depend on plot size.\nFor occupancy, we truncated detections for most species at 125 m from survey points (i.e., half the distance between neighboring points). Ninety-five of the 358 species analyzed are typically detected at distances beyond 125 m such that truncating at this distance would entail excluding most detections. For these species, we truncated at 998 m. Occupancy describes the proportion of plots where at least one member of the species occurs (i.e., presence-absence of the species). As such, occupancy can be multipled by stratum area to estimate the area occupied, and plot size is the resolution for this quantity. For species with 125m radius plots, neighboring plots within a grid cell do not overlap, so estimation of area occupied is readily interpretable as the species range within the stratum. For species with 998m radius plots, neighboring plots can overlap, so a single individual can potentially occupy &gt; 1 plot. For these species, occupancy less readily interpretable as the species range and instead more clearly quantifies space use (Latif et al. 2016). Occupancy estimates are not entirely comparable across species with different plot sizes. Nevertheless, large differences in occupancy should be ecologically meaningful. Trends in occupancy will also be comparable across species regardless of plot size. Additionally, trends in occupancy can be more clearly interpretable as changes in species range regardless of plot size, whereas trends in abundance may primarily reflect changes in population size.\n\n\nModel selection\nFor each species, we considered alternative structures for the observation component of abundance and occupancy models in order to balance model fit, complexity, and computational efficiency. Because accounting for heterogeneity in bird observability is critical for accurate population estimation, we aimed to fit maximally complex observation models supported by the data. Because corrections to count data generated from distance sampling are relatively robust to heterogeneity (see pooling robustness in Buckland et al. 2001:41-42), however, we prioritized allowing heterogeneity in availability over perceptibility for abundance models.\nFor abundance models, we considered two potential functions for describing the decline in perceptibility of birds with distance from the surveyor: a half-normal model and a hazard model. We preliminarily fitted detection-only versions of these models to the raw distance data (i.e., distances not indexed by sampling unit or year). We used the Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC; Watanabe 2010, Hooten and Hobbs 2015) to select the most parsimonious perceptibility functional form and then retained that function for each species for modeling distance-based perceptibility in the primary analysis. As stated above, we only considered constant perceptibility abundance models. Previously, We also considered constant availability models, but we successfully fitted models allowing variation in availability for all species, so we subsequently dropped the constant availability model from consideration.\nFor occupancy models, we occasionally failed to achieve convergence when allowing detectability to vary among years and Bird Conservation Regions, in which case we fitted a constant-detectability model. Since detectability for occupancy models is analogous to the availability component in abundance models, the constant-detectability occupancy model replaces the equivalent of Equation D.20, Equation D.21, and Equation D.22 with\n\\[logit(p) \\sim Normal(0,1). \\tag{D.32}\\]\n\n\nModel fitting\nWe performed all data processing, analysis, and derivation of estimates in R (R Core Team, 2023) and model fitting in Nimble (de Valpine et al. 2017, 2023). All scripts for the annual analysis are maintained in a git repository and available upon request.\nThe R code automated combining strata-level population and trend estimates to derive superstrata estimates at multiple spatial scales, including quantification of estimation uncertainty. Additionally for occupancy models, we automated periodic checking of convergence and switching to the constant-detectability model in cases where relatively the time- and BCR-varying detectability models failed to converge within a specified number of attempts.\nModel fitting with Nimble entailed sampling model parameter space with 2 independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains. For each species, the automated process began sampling with chains of length = 10000 iterations, discarding the first 5000 as burn-in and retaining every 50th sample, then checked convergence of chains using the \\(\\hat{R}\\) metric and effective sample size using \\(n_{effective}\\) (Gelman et al. 2004). We required \\(\\hat{R}&lt;1.1\\) and \\(n_{effective}\\geq 30\\), and continued sampling for another 10000 iterations until we either achieved these criteria or reached the maximum number of attempts, with an attempt being 10000 iterations and checks of \\(\\hat{R}\\) and \\(n_{effective}\\) occurring after each attempt. We specified 50 max attempts for occupancy models allowing variability in detectability and no max for constant detectaiblity.",

    "text": "Bird Conservancy of the Rockies (Bird Conservancy), in conjunction with our partners, conducted the 17th consecutive year of landbird monitoring for the Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions (IMBCR) program. IMBCR is based on a spatially balanced sampling design which provides inference to avian populations at various scales, from local management units to entire states or Bird Conservation Regions, facilitating conservation at local and national levels. The nested design also provides a consistent and flexible framework for understanding and comparing the status and annual changes of bird populations with local and regional context. Collaboration across organizations and spatial scales increases sample sizes and improves the accuracy and precision of population estimates. Analyzing the data collectively allows us to estimate detection probabilities for species that would otherwise have insufficient numbers of detections at local scales. For these reasons, the IMBCR program is well-positioned to address conservation and management needs for a wide range of stakeholders, encouraging an interdisciplinary approach to bird conservation that combines monitoring, research, and management.\nIn 2024, the IMBCR program’s area of inference encompassed four entire states (Colorado, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming) and portions of 12 additional states (Arizona, California, Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, and Texas). We surveyed across US Forest Service (USFS) Regions 1, 2, 3, and 4; all of the Badlands and Prairies Bird Conservation Region (BCR 17), and portions of nine other BCRs: Great Basin (9), Northern Rockies (10), Prairie Potholes (11), Sierra Nevada (15), Southern Rockies/Colorado Plateau (16), Shortgrass Prairie (18), Central Mixed Grass Prairie (19), Sonoran and Mojave Deserts (33), and Sierra Madre Occidental (34).\nObservers conducted 17,844 point counts within 1,627 sampling units between April 25 and July 18, 2024. They detected 206,829 individual birds representing 371 species. This report summarizes the results of the 2024 field season.\nThe IMBCR program has now collected avian occurrence and density data throughout the western US for up to 17 years in some regions. These data enable the program to provide critical trend information on bird populations at local and regional scales. We highlight two examples of these trends for managers and decision-makers to monitor both priority species of concern and common species in decline by accessing data via our recently updated Rocky Mountain Avian Data Center.",

    "text": "Monitoring is an essential component of wildlife management and conservation science (Marsh & Trenham, 2008; Witmer, 2005). Common goals of population monitoring are to estimate the population status of target species and to detect changes in populations over time (Sauer & Knutson, 2008; Thompson, White, & Gowan, 1998). In addition to providing basic information on species distributions, effective monitoring programs can identify species that are at-risk because of small or declining populations (Dreitz, Lukacs, & Knopf, 2006); provide an understanding of how management actions affect populations (Alexander, Stephens, Geupel, & Will, 2008; Lyons, Runge, Laskowski, & Kendall, 2008); and evaluate population responses to landscape alteration and climate change (Baron et al., 2008; Lindenmayer & Likens, 2009).\nWhile monitoring at local scales remains critical, there is an increasing need to monitor the consequences of environmental change over large spatial and temporal scales and address questions much larger than those that can be answered within individual management units (Dreitz, Stinson, Hahn, Tack, & Lukacs, 2017; Lindenmayer & Likens, 2009). Reconciling disparities between the geographic scale of management actions and the scale of ecological and species-specific responses is a persistent challenge for natural resource management agencies (Ruggiero, Hayward, & Squires, 1994). Population monitoring of eco-regional landscapes provides an important context for evaluating population change at local and regional scales, with the potential to identify causal factors and management actions for species recovery (Manley, Schlesinger, Roth, & Van Horne, 2005; Sauer & Knutson, 2008).\nBefore monitoring can be used by land managers to guide conservation efforts, sound program designs and analytical methods are necessary to produce unbiased population estimates (Sauer & Knutson, 2008). At the most fundamental level, reliable knowledge about the status of avian populations requires accounting for spatial variation and incomplete detection of the target species (Pollock et al., 2002; Rosenstock, Anderson, Giesen, Leukering, & Carter, 2002; Thompson, 2002). Addressing spatial variation entails the use of probabilistic sampling designs, which allows population estimates to be extended over the entire area of interest (Thompson et al., 1998). Accounting for incomplete detection involves the use of appropriate sampling and analytical methods to address the fact that few, if any, species are so conspicuous that they are detected with certainty when present during a survey. Accounting for these two sources of variation ensures that observed trends reflect true population changes rather than artifacts of the sampling and observation processes (Pollock et al., 2002; Thompson, 2002).\nThe apparent large-scale declines of avian populations and the loss, fragmentation and degradation of native habitats highlight the need for extensive and rigorous landbird monitoring programs (Rich et al., 2004; US North American Bird Conservation Initiative Monitoring Subcommittee, 2007). The US North American Bird Conservation Initiative’s (NABCI) “Opportunities for Improving Avian Monitoring” (NABCI Monitoring Subcommittee, 2007) provided goals for avian monitoring programs including:\n\nGoal 1: Fully integrate monitoring into bird management and conservation practices and ensure that monitoring is aligned with management and conservation priorities.\nGoal 2: Coordinate monitoring programs among organizations and integrate them across spatial scales to solve conservation or management problems effectively.\nGoal 3: Increase the value of monitoring information by improving statistical design.\nGoal 4: Maintain bird population monitoring data in modern data management systems. Recognize legal, institutional, proprietary, and other constraints while still providing greater availability of raw data, associated metadata, and summary data for bird monitoring programs.\n\nWith the NABCI Monitoring Subcommittee (2007) guidelines in mind, Bird Conservancy of the Rockies and partners initiated a broad-scale collaborative bird monitoring program in 2008 entitled “Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions” (IMBCR) (Blakesley & Hanni, 2009). See Appendix B: IMBCR Program and Stratification History for a complete history of this program. The monitoring objectives of the IMBCR partnership are to:\n\nProvide robust density, population and occupancy estimates that account for incomplete detection and are comparable at different geographic extents;\nProvide long-term status and trend data for all regularly occurring breeding landbird species throughout the study area;\nProvide a design framework to spatially integrate existing bird monitoring efforts in the region to provide better information on distribution and abundance of breeding landbirds, especially for high priority species;\nProvide basic habitat association data for most bird species to address habitat management issues;\nMaintain a high-quality database that effectively merges records between regional data nodes and is accessible to all of our collaborators as well as to the public over the internet, in the form of raw and summarized data; and\nGenerate decision support tools that help guide conservation efforts and provide a better measure of conservation success.\n\nThe IMBCR design includes Bird Conservation Regions (BCRs) as sampling frames (Figure 5.1), stratified by land ownership inside each BCR (NABCI Monitoring Subcommittee, 2007). BCRs provide a spatially consistent framework for bird conservation in North America. Each BCR represents a distinct ecological region with similar bird communities, vegetation types, and resource management interests (NABCI, 2000). Population monitoring within BCRs is implemented with a flexible hierarchical framework of nested units, where information on bird populations can be partitioned into smaller units for small-scale conservation planning, or aggregated to support large-scale conservation efforts. By focusing on scales relevant to management and conservation, information obtained from monitoring in BCRs can be integrated into research and management objectives at various scales applicable to managers (Pavlacky et al., 2017; Ruth et al., 2003).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Bird Conservation Regions throughout North America, excluding Hawaii.",

    "text": "6.2 Sampling Design\n\nSampling Frame and Stratification\nA key feature of the IMBCR design is the ability to estimate bird population parameters at multiple spatial scales, from small management units, such as individual national forests or field offices, to entire states and BCRs. This is accomplished through hierarchical (nested) sampling of smaller within larger units. The fundamental units of the design (and therefore of population estimation) are strata, which are mutually exclusive and together form the programmatic footprint in any given year. Strata-level population estimates can be combined to derive estimates at larger scales for groups of strata (hereafter superstrata). For example, data from each individual national forest stratum in USFS Region 2 are combined to produce Region-wide population estimates; data from each individual stratum in Montana are combined to produce statewide estimates; and data from each individual stratum in BCR 17 are combined to produce BCR-wide estimates.\nWe define strata based on areas to which IMBCR partners wanted to make inferences. Strata contributing to the baseline monitoring effort (hereafter background strata) are nested within the intersection of state and BCR boundaries (e.g., Wyoming-BCR 10). Additionally, we base background strata within the state-BCR sampling frames on fixed attributes, such as land ownership boundaries, elevation zones, major river systems and wilderness/roadless designations. Additional strata defined for particular objectives, such as monitoring within areas subject to management action, are not subject to the same constraints as background strata (hereafter overlay strata).\n\n\nSampling Units\nWe define sampling units as 1 km² cells, each containing 16 evenly spaced sample points, 250 meters apart (Figure 6.2). We define potential sampling units by superimposing a uniform grid of cells over each state in the study area. We then assign each cell to a stratum using ArcGIS version 10.X and higher (Environmental Systems Research Institute, 2017). For all stratifications developed after 2012, we use the United States National Grid (USNG), a nonproprietary alphanumeric referencing system derived from the Military Grid Reference System that was created by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Example 1 km² sampling unit in the IMBCR design.\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Selection\nWithin each stratum, we use generalized random-tessellation stratification (GRTS), a spatially balanced sampling algorithm, to select sampling units (Stevens Jr. & Olsen, 2004). The GRTS design has useful properties with respect to long-term monitoring of birds at large spatial scales including:\n\nSpatially balanced sampling is generally more efficient than simple random sampling of natural resources (Stevens Jr. & Olsen, 2004). Incorporating information about spatial autocorrelation in the data can increase precision in density estimates.\nAll sampling units in the sampling frame are ordered, such that any set of consecutively numbered units is a spatially well-balanced sample (Stevens Jr. & Olsen, 2004). In the case of fluctuating budgets, IMBCR partners can adjust the sampling effort among years within each stratum while still preserving a random, spatially balanced sampling design.\n\nWe require two sampling units to be surveyed within each stratum, but reliable stratum-level occupancy estimates require larger sample sizes, with a minimum of approximately 8-10 samples per stratum. Additional samples may be required for strata comprising large geographic areas. Because we estimate regional density and occupancy using an area weighted mean, adding more samples to a particular stratum does not bias the overall estimate, it simply increases the precision. After the initial two sampling units were selected, the remaining allocation of sampling effort among strata was based on the priorities of the funding partners.",

    "text": "6.3 Sampling Methods\nIMBCR observers with excellent aural and visual bird-identification skills conducted field work in 2022. Prior to conducting surveys, observers completed an intensive training program to ensure full understanding of the field protocol and review bird and plant identification. Observers were also shadowed by a crew leader at the start of the field season to ensure they understood the protocol and could identify all birds within a region.\nObservers conducted point counts (Buckland et al., 2001) following protocols established by IMBCR partners (Hanni, White, Birek, Van Lanen, & McLaren, 2012). Observers conducted surveys in the morning, beginning one-half hour before sunrise and concluding no later than five hours after sunrise. Observers recorded the start time for every point count conducted. For every bird detected during the six-minute period, observers recorded species, sex, horizontal distance from the observer, minute, type of detection (e.g., call, song, visual), whether the bird was thought to be a migrant, and whether the observer was able to visually identify each record.\nObservers measured distances to each bird using laser rangefinders when possible. When it was not possible, observers estimated the distance by measuring to some object near the bird using a laser rangefinder. In addition to recording all bird species detected in the area during point counts, observers recorded birds flying over but not using the immediate surrounding landscape. Observers also recorded Abert’s squirrel (Sciurus aberti), American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), and American pika (Ochotona princeps). While observers traveled between points within a sampling unit, they recorded the presence of any species not recorded during a point count. The opportunistic detections of these species are used for distribution purposes only.\nObservers considered all non-independent detections of birds (i.e., flocks or pairs of conspecific birds together in close proximity) as part of a “cluster” rather than as independent observations. Observers recorded the number of birds detected within each cluster along with a letter code to distinguish between multiple clusters.\nAt the start and end of each survey, observers recorded time, ambient temperature, cloud cover, precipitation, and wind speed. Observers navigated to each point using hand-held Global Positioning System units. Before beginning each six-minute count, surveyors recorded vegetation data within a 50m radius of the point via ocular estimation. Vegetation data included the dominant habitat type and relative abundance, percent cover and mean height of trees and shrubs by species, grass height, and ground cover. Observers recorded vegetation data quietly to allow birds time to return to their normal habits prior to beginning each count.\nFor more detailed information about survey methods and vegetation data collection protocols, refer to Bird Conservancy’s Field Protocol for Spatially Balanced Sampling of Landbird Populations (contact Jennifer Timmer to request a copy.",

    "section": "6.4 Data Analysis",
    "text": "6.4 Data Analysis\n\nFramework and terminology\nWe applied hierarchical models using Bayesian tools to estimate abundance, density, occupancy, and their respective trends. Hereafter, we refer to abundance, density, and occupancy as “primary population parameters”, or simply “population parameters”, and estimates of these parameters as “population estimates”. Abundance is the number of species members present within a specified areal unit and time frame. Density is abundance per unit area (birds per \\(km^2\\)). Occupancy is the probability or proportion of sampling units within an areal unit and time frame where at least one species member is present. Because population estimates are derived from data collected over 6-min surveys conducted once per sampling period (i.e., the breeding season), the time frame of estimation is 6 minutes. Thus, IMBCR abundance and occupancy estimates quantify the number of individuals present and the proportion of sampling units (or area) with \\(\\geq1\\) individual present, respectively, within a 6 minute snapshot in time. In contrast, other monitoring programs that estimate population parameters over longer time frames that allow movement into the sampling unit during the sampling period will tend to quantify the distribution of breeding territories or home ranges (i.e., space use; for further details, see Section D.1.5 in Appendix D).\nGiven our sampling design (see above), the fundamental areal unit of estimation for all parameters is the stratum, and so our models estimate abundance, density, and occupancy for all strata making up the IMBCR programmatic footprint. Additionally, our design allows us to derive population estimates for larger areal units consisting of \\(\\geq2\\) strata (hereafter superstrata) by summarizing across component strata. For density and occupancy, superstrata estimates represent means of component strata weighted by their area. For abundance, we simply sum component strata estimates to derive superstrata estimates. Hereafter, we use the term “areal units” to refer to strata and superstrata in general. To allow flexible trend estimation for any areal unit and time period, trend estimation involves post hoc analysis of annual population estimates generated by a primary estimation model (Appendix D). Finally, analyzing data in a manner consistent with the IMBCR design, we leverage all available information across the IMBCR program to estimate parameters representing the observation process, which by extension improves precision of population estimates. For further details on the structure of our analysis models, see Appendix D.\n\n\nData filtering\nWe set minimum data thresholds applied to each species for estimating population parameters. We estimated abundance and occupancy for all species with \\(\\geq 30\\) detections recorded across the IMBCR program. For species with 10-29 detections, we estimated only occupancy using occupancy models. For species with fewer detections, we did not attempt to estimate any population parameters. These criteria were applied after excluding the furthest 10% of detections following standard practice for distance sampling (see Section D.1.5 in Appendix D). Thus, in practice, the minimum number of detections required was 33 for estimating abundance.\nFor each species, we only analyzed data from strata where the species was detected at least once during at least one year. We thus conditioned strata-level estimation on the species having been detected at least once, thereby (conservatively) excluding strata outside the range of the species. When rolling up strata to superstrata estimates, we assumed surveyed strata that were thus excluded from primary strata-level estimation to have density and occupancy estimates of zero.\n\n\nModel Assumptions\nDistance sampling theory was developed to account for the decreasing probability of perceiving an object of interest (e.g., a bird) with increasing distance from the observer to the object (Buckland et al., 2001). Estimated perceptibility is used to adjust the count of birds to account for birds that were present but not perceived within sampled area. Application of distance theory requires that five critical assumptions be met: 1) all birds at and near the sampling location (distance = 0) are perceived; 2) distances to birds are measured accurately; 3) detected birds do not move in response to the observer’s presence prior to detection (Buckland et al., 2001; Thomas et al., 2010); 4) cluster sizes are recorded without error; and 5) the sampling units are representative of the entire survey region (Buckland, Marsden, & Green, 2008).\nStarting in 2023, we added time-removal sampling to account for imperfect availability for perception. Imperfect availability can arise, for example, from birds being hidden from view and quiet during some portion of their daily activities. The addition of removal sampling data (i.e., the time period of detection within the 6 min survey) can be seen as relaxing assumption 1 (Amundson et al. 2016). Regardless, we now account for two components of detection probability, a spatial component accounting for distance from the surveyor and a temporal component accounting for incomplete availability for detection, theoretically improving accuracy of our population estimates over estimates prior to 2023, which only accounted for the former.",

However, results from all strata and all biologically meaningful superstrata can be found on the Rocky Mountain Avian Data Center 2.0 (RMADC). This online database contains species counts, density, occupancy, and population trend results per stratum, and also interactive maps showing approximate survey locations and detections.

In the past, if a species had been detected in a stratum in a previous year, but was not detected in the current year, we did not provide density or occupancy estimates for that species in that stratum. We now include estimates for these species. In these cases, the estimate for a given year is zero or very close to zero. We consider these to be legitimate estimates of zero occupancy or density because the species occurs in the area of interest, but was not detected in a particular year.\nThis change means that the number of species with density or occupancy estimates for a given stratum or superstratum in a given year is not comparable to the number of species with estimates for that stratum or superstratum and year in reports prior to 2018. The number of species in the current report will include species with zero, or near zero estimates, if that species has been detected in previous years, whereas reports before 2018 will not. Therefore, there may be more species with estimates for a given stratum in a final report for 2018 and later.",

    "text": "Using IMBCR Trends to Assess the Status of Species across Scales\nBird populations in North America have declined precipitously over the last 50 years (Rosenberg et al. 2019). Monitoring the status of both species of concern and formerly common but declining species is thus an important objective for management agencies. However, while national trends can help inform broad priorities and sound the alarm on range-wide declines, management typically occurs locally and regionally.\nThe IMBCR program has now collected avian occurrence and density data throughout the western United States for up to 17 years in some regions. These data enable the program to provide critical trend information on bird populations at multiple scales, from individual management units to state or region-wide. Below, we highlight two examples of these data for managers and decision-makers to monitor both existing priority species and common species in decline by accessing data via our recently updated Rocky Mountain Avian Data Center (RMADC).\nThe Savannah Sparrow is not currently a priority species for conservation throughout its wide distribution (Wheelwright and Rising 2020). However, IMBCR trends show a decline across several populations within the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, from larger regions, like statewide across Colorado to specific management units, such as Yellowstone National Park. Given widespread declines at local and larger scales, efforts to prioritize the Savannah Sparrow may be warranted, at least in the western portion of the species’ range.\nThe Evening Grosbeak is a forest specialist and a Road to Recovery tipping point species that has experienced long term population declines (https://r2rbirds.org/tipping-point-species/). However, IMBCR data show variation in population trends throughout the Rockies. For example, populations in some USFS units, like Kootenai National Forest, have experienced declines, while populations in other units, like Helena National Forest, have increased since 2009. Monitoring populations at both local and regional scales can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of how local and regional processes may interact and affect populations, such as the Evening Grosbeak (Hewitt et al. 2007, Pavlacky et al. 2017).\nVisit the Rocky Mountain Avian Data Center (https://apps.birdconservancy.org/rmadc/) to view trends for species of interest in your management area (click on “Explore the Data” to select filters of interest). IMBCR estimates are available for numerous focal areas or “strata”, where partners have invested in monitoring, such as the Bighorn National Forest in Wyoming. The “Superstratum” filter is helpful to find trends for broader regions or statewide (e.g., the BCR18-portion of Colorado) that provide context for strata. Filter trends by f-value &gt;0.9 to view only robust estimates; these estimates are highlighted in yellow and estimates with a more stringent threshold of f &gt;0.975 are shown in gold. Increasing trends are highlighted in blue, while decreasing trends are shown in red. Please note, we now provide two trend metrics: trend based on the annual density estimates and trend based on occupancy estimates. Although density and occupancy have different units, trend on either is interpreted the same way: as the percent population change per year during the monitoring period. Visit the “Tutorial” page for additional information on using the site and interpreting the estimates.",

    "text": "The availability of consistent monitoring data at multiple scales is an important challenge for avian conservation (Ruth et al., 2003). The IMBCR program meets this challenge through its probabilistic, nested design, which allows for inference to multiple scales of interest, from National Grasslands to states to BCRs (Pavlacky et al., 2017). With this design, we can model habitat relationships to evaluate species’ responses to local management actions and predict species’ distributions for landscape prioritization. Stratification based on eco-regional boundaries and other fixed attributes is also a critical feature of the IMBCR program because it allows for the evaluation of long-term avian responses to landscape and climate change (Metzger et al., 2013; Pavlacky et al., 2017).\nThe importance of long-term population monitoring at larger spatial scales is well known (Jones, 2011; Thompson et al., 1998), but it is often cost-prohibitive. The IMBCR program reduces expenses through cooperation with multiple partners, one of the stated goals of effective collaboration and coordinated bird monitoring (NABCI Monitoring Subcommittee, 2007), and also through efficiencies in data collection and analyses. Partners can investigate priority species and management questions with slight modifications to the IMBCR design, further reducing costs associated with developing new studies and monitoring programs. These cost savings allow for an increased sampling effort and/or for the development of decision support tools to aid land managers and conservation practitioners on the ground. Based on the spatially balanced design, the IMBCR program can also accommodate a shortage of monitoring funds in certain years or strata without reducing the overall rigor of the program (Stevens Jr. & Olsen, 2004).\nThe IMBCR program is well-positioned to address the conservation and management needs of a wide range of stakeholders due to its rigorous, hierarchical design and the strength of the IMBCR partnership. This partnership is an ongoing collaboration between multiple entities from state and federal agencies to non-governmental organizations and Joint Ventures, and was created to address management and conservation objectives of larger avian programs like NABCI (NABCI Monitoring Subcommittee, 2007). Through the IMBCR partnership, monitoring resources are pooled, creating efficiencies and allowing for inference to larger landscapes (Pavlacky et al., 2017). By providing essential knowledge of bird populations at multiple scales relevant to management and conservation, the IMBCR program informs prioritization of management actions and facilitates a collaborative approach to bird conservation (Ruth et al., 2003, Pavlacky et al., 2017).",

    "text": "Selecting filters\nThe Rocky Mountain Avian Data Center has been designed to provide information for specific regions and species, and therefore works best when users select multiple filters for a query.\nFor example, to view IMBCR results for Brewer’s sparrow in Colorado, you would select the following filters: Species = Brewer’s Sparrow and State = Colorado). Below is an explanation of the different filter types you may choose from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo navigate the filters, it’s helpful to use this report to determine the Stratum or Superstratum relevant to you. Click on the relevant agency or geographic region on the sidebar on the left side of this page, then use the “On this page” menu to choose a management unit. The relevant Stratum or Superstratum will be listed in a callout block like this one.\n\n\n\nGeographic filters\nBird Conservation Region: Selecting this filter will provide you with results for all strata and superstrata within a particular Bird Conservation Region - see Figure 5.1 for a map.\nState: Selecting this filter will supply the user with data and results for all strata and superstrata within a particular state.\nLand Management Agency: This filter will allow users to select data and results for All Other Lands, Colorado State Land Board, The Nature Conservancy (TNC), US Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), US Bureau of Land Management (BLM), US Department of Defense (DOD), US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), US Forest Service (USFS), or National Park Service (NPS).\nStratum (eg, management unit): This filter allows users to select data and results for a geographic unit of analysis, often an individual management unit.\nSuperstratum (eg, region): This filter allows users to select data and results for multiple strata that were analyzed jointly. Superstrata often represent regions or entire states (e.g., the state of Colorado is split into 30 individual strata), but sometimes management units are stratified by management features and analyzed as a superstratum (e.g., Bridger-Teton National Forest is split into two strata reflecting roadless and roaded areas).\n\n\nOther filters\nSpecies: This filter allows users to select data and results for a particular or group species.\nYear: This filter will allow users to select all data and results for a particular year.",

    "text": "Viewing Density, Occupancy and Trend Results (Density, Occupancy, and Trend Estimates Tabs)\nViewing Tables\nYou may view density, occupancy or trend results tables for all appropriate strata (based on the selected filters) for which we have results, by clicking on the tabs above the map labeled “Density”, “Occupancy” or “Trend Estimates”.\nThe occupancy tables display species, stratum name, year, occupancy (probability that sampling plots are occupied by at least 1 individual of a species), number of surveyed points the species was detected on, and the percent coefficient of variation (% CV, an indicator of reliability for density or occupancy). The density tables display species, stratum name, year, number of birds estimated per km² (D) within the stratum, percent coefficient of variation (% CV), and the number of independent detections used in analyses (n). We classify density and occupancy estimates as “robust” if the CV is &lt; 50% (these records will be highlighted in gold in the tables).\nThe trend tables display the stratum name, species, years (i.e., the monitoring period), and then two sets of trend estimates: trend based on the annual density estimates and trend based on the annual occupancy estimates. Trend for density and occupancy is interpreted as the percent change per year of the monitoring period. The “f” value for both trends is the probability that the trend is in the direction of the reported % change. For example, if a trend estimate is 5.5 and the f value is 0.95, this means the population has increased 5.5% each year of the monitoring period and we are 95% certain the population has increased. Robust trends have an f value &gt; 0.9 and these records are highlighted in yellow in the trend tables. Some partners prefer to use a more stringent cut-off of f &gt; 0.975, and these records are highlighted in gold. The 95% CI is the 95% credible interval, which contains the true population trend with 95% certainty. 95% CIs which do not overlap zero are equivalent to f &gt; 0.975. Note that trend estimates with an f value between 0.9-0.975, although robust, will have 95% CIs that overlap 0. This is because f &gt; 0.9 is equivalent to an 80% CI that does not overlap 0.\nStratum and Superstratum Results\nDensity, occupancy, and trend estimates will always be displayed by individual strata in the top table and by superstrata that the individual strata contribute to in the bottom table. If you use the “Stratum” filter to select an individual management unit, estimates for all relevant superstrata will be included in the table below for regional context. If you use the “Superstratum” filter to select a region or state, estimates for all individual strata contained within that superstratum will be included in the top table. This provides automatic context for local populations with regional populations. For example, use the Stratum filter to select WY-BCR10-BI: Bighorn National Forest, and the top table will show estimates for Bighorn National Forest. The bottom table will show estimates for3 main superstrata: statewide in Wyoming, the BCR10-portion of WY, and USFS-Region 2 National Forests.\nDownload results of your query\nYou may easily download the results of your query as a CSV file by clicking the Download button below each table.\nViewing the Density Charts\nWhen viewing the density charts, the point estimate of density for a given year is indicated with a circle, and the error bars represent the 95% credible interval. We will include occupancy charts in future RMADC updates.",

Additionally, there were several re-stratifications done in Colorado BCRs 10 and 16 between 2009 and 2010. The Colorado BCR 10 stratum was re-stratified to include the small easternmost portion of BCR 10 that dips into Colorado so all Colorado BCR 10 lands are represented. The “NPS Rocky Mountain Inventory and Monitoring Network (RMNW)” and “Northern Colorado Plateau Inventory and Monitoring Network (NCPN)” were re-stratified because some NCPN park units were initially misclassified into the RMNW stratum. In Wyoming, the USFS Region 4 stratum was re-stratified into three separate strata: “Bridger-Teton National Forest front-country/managed areas”, “Bridger-Teton National Forest designated roadless/wilderness areas” and “the remainder of USFS Region 4 lands in Wyoming BCR 10”.

Additionally, there were several re-stratifications done in Colorado. The Colorado BCR 10 stratum was split into two strata: BLM Lands and All Other Lands. This was done to facilitate improved tracking of priority species on BLM lands throughout Colorado. Rio Grande National Forest and White River National Forest strata were each split into three strata: low, medium, and high elevations. This stratification by elevation allowed sampling intensity changes to target Management Indicator Species on the forests. The Routt National Forest and Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests strata were reorganized and a third stratum, the Williams Fork Area, was created from the two because it had mixed administration between the Routt National Forest and the Arapahoe and Roosevelt National Forests.\nThe RMNW stratum was re-stratified to accurately reflect land ownership. There was a land acquisition within Great Sand Dunes National Monument and some samples were removed from Rio Grande National Forest and added to the RMNW stratum; 16 km² were added to the area of the RMNW strata. In South Dakota, the Black Hills National Forest stratum was split into two strata based on watersheds in the Forest: Hydrologic Code 7 Watersheds and all other watersheds. Stratification by watershed allows for adjusting sampling intensity to target Management Indicator Species on the Forest.",

The new strata include “All Other Lands in the Region 1 portion of Idaho BCR 10” (all lands outside of national forest boundaries), “All Other Lands in the Region 4 portion of Idaho BCR 10” (all lands outside of national forest boundaries), “other USFS lands in the Region 1 portion of Idaho BCR 10” and “USFS designated roadless/wilderness areas within the Region 4 portion of Idaho BCR 10”. In Arizona, Tonto National Forest became a part of the IMBCR survey effort. The forest was stratified into two strata based on elevation to allow sampling intensity changes to target Management Indicator Species on the Forests. Kaibab National Forest was re-stratified into two strata based on elevation for the same reason. In Montana, several strata were re-stratified and combined within BCR 17. The three “All Other Lands” strata were combined with the “Tribal Lands” stratum into one “All Other Lands” stratum. The four BLM strata within Montana BCR 17 were combined into one BLM stratum. These strata were collapsed into larger strata to maximize the number of samples conducted within two strata rather than spread them out amongst eight strata.",

    "text": "2013\n2013 brought significant changes to the program’s overall stratification methods. The original IMBCR sampling grids were created at the state scale and as the program expanded, additional sampling grids were created at the BCR scale. In response to a rapidly growing monitoring program, the partnership acknowledged the need for a standard national grid system to promote the coordination and application of monitoring data in conservation. The group proposed the use of the United States National Grid (USNG), a national grid system created by the Federal Geographic Data Committee, as its standard. There are three advantages to using the USNG. First, the use of standard grids allows for the integration of datasets and subsequent identification of areas where sampling should or has not occurred. Second, it provides a means to identify sampled areas in a consistent manner so results of monitoring projects can be evaluated in a spatially comparable way. Lastly, it facilitates regional and national-level avian distribution modeling and the development of broad-scale avian distribution maps. This standard was approved by the NABCI committee. Bird Conservancy started using the USNG for new stratification and re-stratification schemes in 2013.\nWe added several USFS strata to the sampling frame for the 2013 field season – Coronado National Forest in southern Arizona, Carson National Forest in north-central New Mexico, and Caribou-Targhee National Forest in southeastern Idaho. Coronado and Carson National Forests were stratified into two strata based on elevation to allow for adjusting sampling intensity to target Management Indicator Species on the Forests. Because Caribou-Targhee National Forest spans three states and three BCRs, it was necessary to divide the forest into four strata. The state and BCR-level stratification distinctions allowed the summation of the data for individual states or BCRs. The four new strata in Idaho and Utah join a preexisting Caribou-Targhee stratum in west-central Wyoming as a part of Wyoming’s statewide effort. In addition, Pawnee National Grassland was split into two strata – public lands and private lands – since Pawnee National Grassland contains a large amount of private land within its administrative boundary. This allowed the USFS to concentrate more survey effort specifically on public lands. In Wyoming, the preexisting stratum in BCR 10 containing all USFS Region 4 lands (other than Bridger-Teton National Forest) was re-stratified into three separate strata, one for each Forest (Caribou-Targhee, Ashley, and Wasatch). This allows for forest-wide estimates within Caribou-Targhee National Forest. If, in the future, Ashley and Wasatch National Forests are completely sampled, this will also allow for forest-wide estimates in each of those forests.\nThe North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska portions of BCR 17 underwent a complete re-stratification to incorporate several NPS Northern Great Plains Inventory and Monitoring Network (NGPN) strata. All of the non-NPS strata in these states were retained, but renamed to avoid confusion. The NPS strata were stratified by NPS unit to allow the NGPN to monitor birds on each of its units separately. New strata included Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site, Theodore Roosevelt National Park, Badlands National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, Mount Rushmore National Monument, and Wind Cave National Park.\nNebraska BCR 18 also underwent a complete re-stratification to allow for the individual stratification of Agate Fossil Beds and Scotts Bluff National Monuments. We also added an additional stratum for Cherry Ranch, a property owned by The Nature Conservancy (TNC).",

    "text": "2014\nIn Colorado, the Arapaho and Roosevelt and the Pike and San Isabel National Forests were re-stratified to allow these forests to monitor treatments intended to mitigate fire hazard and improve forest health. We divided each forest into two strata: a control stratum and the remainder of the forest. The control portion of the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests consists of lands ranging in elevation from 6,000 ft. (1,829 m) to 9,000 ft. (2,743 m) and excludes treatment areas and areas burned between 1998 and 2013. The Pike and San Isabel control stratum ranges from 6,000 ft. (1,829 m) to 9,500 ft. (2,896 m) and excludes treatment areas and areas burned between 1998 and 2013. We created a single experiment overlay stratum for all of Arapaho and Roosevelt and Pike and San Isabel National Forests consisting of actual treatment areas (areas with &gt;30% treatment). Since this stratum spans multiple forests, it is not considered to be a part of the IMBCR design; however, detections from this stratum do contribute to the number of detections used in analyses.\nSignificant stratification changes were made to the BCR 10 portion of Idaho. The four strata defined in the 2012 field season were further subdivided into nine strata. The boundary between USFS Regions 1 and 4 runs through Idaho and was taken into account when re-stratifying so that estimates could be generated at the USFS Region level. The new strata created in Idaho BCR 10 include the “Idaho portion of Bitterroot National Forest”, “BLM Lands within Idaho BCR10”, “Boise National Forest”, “the Idaho portion of Kootenai National Forest”, “Payette National Forest”, “Salmon-Challis National Forest”, “Sawtooth National Forest”, “All other Lands within Idaho BCR 10 and USFS Region 1” (all lands outside of national forest and BLM boundaries) and “All Other Lands within Idaho BCR 10 and USFS Region 4” (all lands outside of national forest and BLM boundaries). Since Bitterroot and Kootenai National Forests span Idaho and Montana, 2014 density and occupancy estimates for those forests included strata from both states. In the past, “forest-wide” estimates have only represented the Montana portion of these forests.\nWe subdivided the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) strata in Montana BCRs 11 and 17 to allow density and occupancy estimation specifically within the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge. Previously, we grouped all USFWS lands together in these BCRs, limiting estimates for individual refuges. In each BCR, we created two new strata – a Charles M. Russel NWR stratum and an “All Other USFWS Lands” stratum.\nIn addition to re-stratification, we added a few new strata to the IMBCR program in 2014. In Nebraska, NGPN began monitoring on the Niobrara National Scenic River spanning BCRs 17 and 19. In Utah, we created a new stratum for Manti-La Sal National Forest. Previously, only the Colorado portion of Manti-La Sal was stratified and surveyed. The additional Utah portion allows for the generation of forest-wide estimates for Manti-La Sal.",

    "text": "2015\nIn 2015, the Department of Defense (DoD) stratum in Colorado BCR 18 was completely re-stratified as part of a DoD Legacy Resource Management Program Grant to represent six individual military installations: US Air Force Academy, Fort Carson, Pueblo Chemical Depot, Piñon Canyon, and All Other DoD Lands. This DoD installation-level stratification allows for the generation of density and occupancy estimates for each installation. Fort Carson and Piñon Canyon were further stratified by areas within range fans (training zones) and areas outside of range fans to allow the DoD to assess the effects of military training on bird species.\nThe Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge stratum also came out of the 2015 re-stratification. During WWII, the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, as it was originally known, was a chemical weapons manufacturing facility. At the time of the 2008 IMBCR stratification in the state Colorado, it was still partially owned by the US Army and was included in the DoD stratum. The refuge is now in its own individual stratum.\nThe IMBCR program expanded to include the Missouri National Recreational River (MNRR), part of the NPS NGPN in Nebraska and South Dakota. There are two strata for MNRR representing the 39 Mile District and the 59 Mile District. In Utah, an additional stratum was added for Sanpitch Recreation Area. This area is part of Uinta National Forest but administered by Manti-La Sal National Forest and will be incorporated into forest-wide estimates for Manti-La Sal National.",

    "section": "2016",
    "text": "2016\nIn 2016, the Playa Lakes Joint Venture (PLJV) coordinated a partnership between several state wildlife agencies and Bird Conservancy to expand sampling in five of the joint venture’s six states: Nebraska, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. PLJV’s sixth state, Colorado, was already included in the IMBCR program starting in 2008. This expansion now provides the program with nearly complete coverage of two BCRs that were only sparsely covered in past years: Shortgrass Prairie (BCR 18) and Central Mixed Grass Prairie (BCR 19). The BCR 18 and 19 portions of these 5 states were divided into several strata, including, playas, rivers, biologically unique landscapes in Nebraska, and all other lands.\nThe IMBCR program also underwent a major expansion into the state of Utah in 2016. The entire state was stratified into BLM, USFS, DoD, and All Other Lands strata. This year was somewhat of a pilot year, with select BLM, USFS, DoD, and all other lands strata sampled across the state. In future years, sampling will be increased to a statewide level.\nIn addition to new strata, some existing strata were re-stratified for a variety of reasons. In North and South Dakota, we re-stratified the Tribal and All Other Lands strata to ensure all tribal lands were only included in the tribal lands strata. In the past, some tribal lands could still be found within the All Other Lands strata. We also re-stratified Cimarron, Kiowa, and Rita Blanca National Grasslands in Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. With the expansion of IMBCR throughout the PLJV region, these strata needed to be fit to the US National Grid to make them consistent with the rest of the IMBCR program in the region. In addition, we determined that the portion of Rita Blanca National Grassland that fell in New Mexico was actually managed by Kiowa National Grassland, so that portion was moved to the Kiowa National Grasslands stratum. All DoD lands in Colorado BCR18 were combined into one stratum. This was the same stratification used prior to 2015.",

    "text": "2010\nBeginning in 2010, the point count duration was increased from five minutes to six minutes to facilitate occupancy estimation, which is easier to analyze using equal time intervals (in this case, two minutes each). Observers began recording juvenile birds detected during point counts. Observers placed a “J” in the sex column for these detections. Previously, juvenile birds were not recorded because this study focuses on recording breeding birds. Juvenile bird detections are used for distribution mapping purposes only and are not factored into data analysis. A minute column was added to the bird datasheet so observers could record the actual minute of each bird detection during a point count. Previously, observers used tick marks to separate minute intervals. We added a “visual” checkbox to the bird datasheet for observers to check if they visually observed and identified any of the species recorded. This reminds observers that they need to look for birds in addition to listening for them and helps crew leaders make decisions regarding unusual or rare bird detections while proofing data. We provided observers with an additional datasheet to record the reasons points were not surveyed (e.g., weather issues, unsafe terrain, denied permission by landowner, etc.). This sheet also provided space to record additional landowner information as needed. Lastly, observers began recording horizontal distance to each flyover detection. In the past, we did not record distances because we do not use flyover detections in analysis. However, observers sometimes incorrectly distinguish flyovers from birds using the surrounding habitat while foraging on the wing (e.g., swallows, swifts, and raptors). Therefore, if we find an incorrectly recorded flyover, we can still use the detection data in analysis.",

    "text": "2012\nIn 2012, observers began recording the start time for every point count conducted so we could use temporal information as a variable in analyses. Start times for the entire transect and for individual points were all recorded in Mountain Daylight Time for consistency across the region. Prior to 2012, observers were allowed to conduct point counts until 11:00 AM local time each day. In order to account for variability across study areas from Arizona to Montana, crew leaders instructed observers to survey no later than five hours after sunrise in 2012. Observers also began noting migrant detections on surveys. After the field season, we thoroughly review the migrant records; if those records are verified, they are not included in analysis. Previously, crew leaders instructed observers to record a bird as a male if 1) it was a singing warbler or sparrow, or 2) it was singing repeatedly and emphatically. In 2012, we instructed observers to only identify the sex of a visually observed bird of a sexually dimorphic species. We instructed observers to record subspecies only if they visually identified a bird as such. In the past, we used geographic range to assume a bird was of a particular subspecies. Up until the 2012 field season, we provided observers with a list of rare or difficult to detect species to record while traveling between points within a sampling unit. In 2012, in order to simplify the protocol and collect more useful information, we eliminated the list and observers recorded any species they came across while traveling between points they had not documented during a point count. That way all species encountered within the sampling unit would be documented for distribution mapping purposes.\nAlso in 2012, several changes were made to the vegetation datasheet. First, we removed distance to the nearest road, forest structural stage and human structures from the data sheet. We no longer collect these types of data in the field because they can be obtained through remote sensing. Second, we modified the datasheet to simply record whether a mid-story was present. In the past, if mid-story vegetation was present, observers would record the species found in that layer. Data analysis found mid-story vegetation data to be extremely variable from year to year. Third, we added a ground cover category for residual grass. Finally, we limited acceptable overstory, understory, and ground cover relative abundance values to 1%, 5%, or increments of 10%. In the past, observers estimated cover to the nearest percent for all categories where percent cover or relative abundance was recorded. We made the change to improve the consistency of cover and relative abundance estimates and to decrease the amount of time observers spend estimating these values.\nIn 2012, crew leaders provided observers with two additional data sheets to facilitate working on private lands. The first contained specific information about the land ownership of each point located within a given sampling unit. In cases where a point fell on private property, the data sheet contained the name, contact information and any pertinent notes about the landowner. The second data sheet was a contact log where observers recorded all contacts or attempted contacts they had with landowners. This information was later entered into the landowner database when the observer had internet access.",

    "text": "Indices\nThe following indices are used in all model descriptions:\n\\(i\\) - strata with max \\(I\\)\n\\(j\\) - grid cells with max \\(J\\)\n\\(k\\) - points within a grid cell with max \\(K=16\\), and \\(K_{[s]}\\) is the number of points surveyed in grid cell \\(j\\)\n\\(l\\) - Bird Conservation Regions with max \\(L\\); note that strata are nested with Bird Conservation Regions, so an index \\(i\\) implies indexing by \\(l\\).\n\\(d\\) - distance bins with max \\(d_{[max]}=10\\)\n\\(d_{[mid]}\\), \\(d_{[low]}\\), and \\(d_{[high]}\\) are the distance mid-point, lower bound, and upper bound for distance bin \\(d\\). \\(d_{[max,high]}\\) is the upper bound for the furthest distance bin (i.e., the radius of the entire point-level plot).\n\\(r\\) – 2-min time removal bins within the 6-min survey with max \\(R=3\\)\n\\(t\\) – years with max \\(T\\)\n\\(m\\) – posterior samples\n\n\nAbundance model\nWe modeled abundance and occupancy using separate models. We describe the abundance model here and subsequently describe the occupancy model.\n\nState process\nThe abundance model includes a sub-model quantifying occupancy of grid cells, upon which abundance is conditioned (i.e., we estimate abundance within occupied grid cells).\n\\[z_{ijt} \\sim Bernoulli(ψ_{it}) \\tag{D.1}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[logit(ψ_{it}) \\sim Normal(μ_{[ψ],t},SD_{[ψ],t}^{2}), \\tag{D.2}\\]\nwhere \\(ψ_{it}\\) is the probability of species occupancy of a grid cell in stratum \\(i\\) in year \\(t\\), \\(z_{ijt}\\) is the latent occupancy state of grid cell \\(j\\) in stratum \\(i\\) during year \\(t\\), and \\(μ_{[ψ],t}\\) and \\(SD_{[ψ],t}^{2}\\) are year-specific mean and variance hyper-parameters. We exclude data for all strata in which the species was never detected (effectively conditioning occupancy on being within the species range). We model abundance of independent clusters of individuals within \\(d_{[max,high]}\\) of points within an occupied grid cell as\n\\[N_{ijt} \\sim Poisson(λ_{ijt}×z_{ijt}) \\tag{D.3}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[log(λ_{ijt})=α_{it}+ε_{jt}. \\tag{D.4}\\]\nwhere \\(α_{it}\\) and \\(ε_{jt}\\) are stratum- and grid-cell-specific random effects, respectively, and \\(α_{it}\\) is also subject to a fixed effect of year:\n\\[α_{it} \\sim Normal(μ_{[α],t},SD_{[α],t}^{2}) \\tag{D.5}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ε_{it} \\sim Normal(0,SD_{[ε]}^{2}). \\tag{D.6}\\]\nWe estimated \\(SD_{[α],t}\\) and \\(SD_{[ε]}\\) with gamma priors. For \\(SD_{[α],t}\\), we used a completely uninformed \\(gamma(1,1)\\) prior. For \\(SD_{[ε]}\\), we used a somewhat informed \\(gamma(1.015117, 3.807330)\\) prior based on the distribution of posterior estimates of this parameter across species from earlier analysis. We derive density, D, as\n\\[D_{ijt}= \\frac{N_{ijt}× \\hat{\\bar{s}}}{K×∑_{d=1}^{d_{[max]}}A_{d}}, \\tag{D.7}\\]\nwhere \\(K×∑_{d=1}^{d_{[max]}}A_{d}\\) is the effective area (\\(km^{2}\\)) of estimation for a grid cell and \\(\\hat{\\bar{s}}\\) is the estimated mean size for independent clusters, which is sampled from the distribution\n\\[\\hat{\\bar{s}} \\sim Normal(\\hat{\\mu_{s}},\\hat{SE_s}), \\tag{D.8}\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\mu_s}=Mean(s)\\) and \\(\\hat{SE_s}=SD(s)/\\sqrt{n}\\), in which \\(s\\) represents observed cluster sizes and \\(n\\) is the number of independent clusters detected. We derive stratum-level density estimates by averaging all \\(D_{ijt}\\) within each stratum, and we take the area-weighted average of strata estimates to obtain superstrata density and occupancy estimates.\n\n\nObservation process\nWe model the sum of observed counts (of independent clusters of individuals) across all points surveyed within a grid cell (\\(n_{ijt}\\)) as\n\\[n_{ijt} \\sim Binomial\\biggl(N_{ijt},p_{[a],tl}×p_{[p],t}×\\biggl(\\frac{K_{[s],ijt}}{K}\\biggr)\\biggr), \\tag{D.9}\\]\nwhere \\(p_{[a],tl}\\) is a year- and BCR-specific availability component of detection probability, \\(p_{[p],t}\\) is a year-specific perceptibility component of detection probability, and \\(K_{[s],ijt}⁄K\\) is survey effort. Detection components can be expressed as the sum of probability vectors:\n\\[p_{[a],tl}=∑_{r=1}^{R} π_{[a],tlr} \\tag{D.10}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[p_{[p],tl}=∑_{d=1}^{d_{max}} π_{[p],tld}, \\tag{D.11}\\]\nwhere \\(π_{[a],tlr}\\) and \\(π_{[p],tld}\\) are detection probabilities within time removal and distance bins (hereafter bin probabilities), respectively. We model the distribution of counted individuals among time removal and distance bins, respectively, as\n\\[\\mathbf{y_{[a],ijt}} \\sim Multinomial \\biggl(n_{ijt},\\mathbf{π_{[a],tl}^{[c]}} \\biggr) \\tag{D.12}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\\mathbf{y_{[p],ijt}} \\sim Multinomial \\biggl(n_{ijt},\\mathbf{π_{[p],tl}^{[c]}} \\biggr), \\tag{D.13}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{y_{[a],ijt}}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y_{[p],ijt}}\\) are vectors of counts within time removal and distance bins. Bin probabilities for availability assume constant availability across the survey period,\n\\[π_{[a],trl}=p_{[ar],tl} (1-p_{[ar],tl})^{r-1}, \\tag{D.14}\\]\nwhere \\(p_{[ar],tl}\\) is the availability for a single 2-min time removal bin. Bin probabilities for perceptibility account for area of bins with increasing distance,\n\\[π_{[p],td}=\\frac{p_{[pd],td}A_d}{∑_{d=1}^{d_{[max]}}A_d},~\\mathrm{and} \\tag{D.15}\\]\nwhere \\(p_{[pd],td}\\) is the perceptibility within distance bin \\(d\\) in year \\(t\\), and \\(A_d\\) is the area of distance bin \\(d\\). Multinomial cell probabilites for modeling \\(\\mathbf{y_{[a],ijt}}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{y_{[p],ijt}}\\) represent bin probabilites scaled to sum to 1:\n\\[π_{[a],trl}^{[c]}=π_{[a],trl}⁄p_{[a],tl}, \\tag{D.16}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[π_{[p],td}^{[c]}=π_{[p],td}⁄p_{[p],t}. \\tag{D.17}\\]\nSurveys in 2008-2009 were 5 min instead of 6 min in length, so for these years, we calculate the availability for a 1-min interval, \\(p_{[a1],tl}=1-\\biggl((1-p_{[ar],tl})^3\\biggr)^{1/6}\\), and then calculate the unscaled cell probability for the third (1 min) period as \\(π_{[a],(t≤2)(r=3)l}=p_{[a1],tl}×(1-p_{[ar],tl})^{r-1}\\). We model \\(p_{[pd],td}\\) using one of four possible perceptibility models: 1) a half-normal constant model, 2) a hazard rate constant model, 3) a half-normal year model, and 4) a hazard rate year model. For half-normal functions, we calculated \\(p_{[pd],td}\\) for each distance class as:\n\\[p_{[pd],td}=\\frac{2\\pi\\int_{c=d_{[low]}}^{c=d_{[high]}}exp\\biggl(-\\biggl(\\frac{c^2}{2\\sigma_{t^2}}\\biggr)\\biggr)c~dc}{A_d}, \\tag{D.18}\\]\nwhere \\(d_{[low]}\\) and \\(d_{[high]}\\) are the bounds for distance bin \\(d\\) and \\(σ_t\\) is the half-normal shape parameter. Because of the lack of an analytical solution to the integral of the hazard rate function, we calculated \\(p_{[pd],td}\\) at the midpoint, \\(d_{[mid]}\\), of each distance class:\n\\[p_{[pd],td}=1-exp\\biggl(-\\biggl(\\frac{d_{[mid]}}{h_t}\\biggr)^b\\biggr), \\tag{D.19}\\]\nwhere \\(h_t\\) and \\(b\\) are estimated parameters for the hazard function. For perceptibility models (Equation D.18 and Equation D.19), we draw year-specific shape parameters from hyperdistributions:\n\\[log(σ_t) \\sim Normal(μ_{[σ]},SD_{[σ]}^2), \\tag{D.20}\\]\n\\[log(h_t) \\sim Normal(μ_{[h]},SD_{[h]}^2). \\tag{D.21}\\]\nWe allowed availability to vary by year and BCR:\n\\[logit(p_{[ar],tl}) \\sim Normal(μ_{[p_{ar}]},SD_{[p_{ar}]}^2). \\tag{D.22}\\]\nPriors for annual variation in detectability components are\n\\[μ_{[σ]} \\sim Normal(4.5,1.5), \\tag{D.23}\\]\n\\[μ_{[h]} \\sim Normal(4.5,1.5), \\tag{D.24}\\]\n\\[μ_{[p_{ar}]} \\sim Normal(0,1), \\tag{D.25}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[SD_{[σ]},SD_{[h]},SD_{[p_{ar}]} \\sim gamma(1,1). \\tag{D.26}\\]\n\n\n\nOccupancy model\nWe describe here the occupancy model, which estimates occupancy of points conditioned on occupancy of grid cells.\n\nState process\nWe model species occupancy of grid cells in the same manner as for the abundance model (Equation D.1, Equation D.2). We model species occupancy of points within an occupied grid cell as\n\\[u_{ijt}|z_{ijt} \\sim Binomial(K,θ_{it}×z_{ijt}) \\tag{D.27}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[logit(θ_{it}) \\sim Normal(μ_{[θ],t},SD_{[θ],t}^{2}), \\tag{D.28}\\]\nwhere \\(θ_{it}\\) is the probability of species occupancy of a point within an occupied grid cell in stratum \\(i\\) and year \\(t\\), \\(u_{ijt}\\) is the latent occupancy state describing the number of points occupied within grid cell \\(j\\), stratum \\(i\\), and year \\(t\\), and \\(μ_{[θ],t}\\) and \\(SD_{[θ],t}^{2}\\) are year-specific mean and variance hyper-parameters.\n\n\nObservation process\nWe model species detections at points using\n\\[y_{ijt} \\sim Binomial\\biggl(u_{ijt},p_{tl}×\\biggl(\\frac{K_{[s],ijt}}{K}\\biggr)\\biggr), \\tag{D.29}\\]\nwith \\(p_{tl}\\) is a year- and BCR-specific detection probability and \\(K_{[s],ijt}⁄K\\) is survey effort. Overall species detectability for a point survey, \\(p_{tl}\\), summarizes the probability vector\n\\[p_{tl}=∑_{r=1}^{R} \\mathbf{π_{[R],tl}^{[c]}} \\tag{D.30}\\]\nconsisting of multinomial cell probabilities for\n\\[\\mathbf{y_{[R],ijt}} \\sim Multinomial \\biggl(y_{ijtl}, \\mathbf{π_{[R],tl}^{[c]}} \\biggr), \\tag{D.31}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{y_{[R],ijt}}\\) is a vector of representing the frequency of points where the species was detected across time removal bins when first detected. Cell probabilities for the time removal model assume constant detectability across the survey period,\n\\[π_{[R],trl}=p_{[R],tl} (1-p_{[R],tl})^{r-1}, \\tag{D.32}\\]\nand are scaled to sum to 1,\n\\[π_{[R],trl}^{[c]}=π_{[R],trl}⁄p_{tl}, \\tag{D.33}\\]\nwhere \\(p_{[R],tl}\\) is species detectability for a single 2-min time removal bin. We model variability in species detectability here (\\(p_{[R],tl}\\)) in the same manner as the availability component of the abundance model (\\(p_{[ar]}\\) in Equation D.22, Equation D.25, and Equation D.26), including the shorter 5-min survey period in 2008-2009 (see explanation following Equation D.16).\n\n\n\nTrend estimation\nWe derived posterior estimates of occupancy and abundance trends for any strata or superstrata for desired time periods from strata or (rolled-up) superstrata estimates of occupancy or density, respectively. For stratum or superstratum \\(i\\) we fitted a generalized linear model (GLM) to each posterior sample, m, of density or occupancy estimates:\n\\[log(\\hat{D}_{itm}) \\sim α_{[D],im}+r_{[D],im}×(t-1)~\\mathrm{or} \\tag{D.34}\\]\n\\[logit(\\hat{ψ}_{itm}×\\hat{θ}_{it}) \\sim α_{[ψθ],im}+r_{[ψθ],im}×(t-1). \\tag{D.35}\\]\nFor occupancy, we multiplied \\(ψ×θ\\) to derive the unconditional probability of a point being occupied by the species, and then derived trends. We retained the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the slope, \\(\\tilde{r}_{im}\\), which is equivalent to the least squares trend. We also retained the MLE of the intercept \\(\\tilde{α}_{im}\\). We then summarized across \\(m\\) to derive the posterior estimates for \\(r\\) and predicted \\(D\\) and \\(ψ×θ\\).\n\n\nPlot size\nFollowing established practice for distance sampling data (Buckland et al. 2001:15, 151), we truncated detections for each species beyond the 90% quantile of recorded distances from the surveyor. The purpose of this practice is to improve the fit of the perceptibility curve by minimizing the influence of outliers on estimation (e.g., \\(p_{[p],tl}\\) in Equation D.11). The plot size for abundance estimation technically corresponds with truncation distance, but because density is abundance scaled by area, interpretation of density does not depend on plot size.\nFor occupancy, we truncated detections for most species at 125 m from survey points (i.e., half the distance between neighboring points). Ninety-five of the 358 species analyzed are typically detected at distances beyond 125 m such that truncating at this distance would entail excluding most detections. For these species, we truncated at 998 m. Occupancy describes the proportion of plots where at least one member of the species occurs (i.e., presence-absence of the species). As such, occupancy can be multipled by stratum area to estimate the area occupied, and plot size is the resolution for this quantity. For species with 125m radius plots, neighboring plots within a grid cell do not overlap, so estimation of area occupied is readily interpretable as the species range within the stratum. For species with 998m radius plots, neighboring plots can overlap, so a single individual can potentially occupy &gt; 1 plot. For these species, occupancy less readily interpretable as the species range and instead more clearly quantifies space use (Latif et al. 2016). Occupancy estimates are not entirely comparable across species with different plot sizes. Nevertheless, large differences in occupancy should be ecologically meaningful. Trends in occupancy will also be comparable across species regardless of plot size. Additionally, trends in occupancy can be more clearly interpretable as changes in species range regardless of plot size, whereas trends in abundance may primarily reflect changes in population size.\n\n\nModel selection\nFor each species, we considered alternative structures for the observation component of abundance and occupancy models in order to balance model fit, complexity, and computational efficiency. Because accounting for heterogeneity in bird observability is critical for accurate population estimation, we aimed to fit maximally complex observation models supported by the data. Moreover, because corrections to count data generated from distance sampling are relatively robust to heterogeneity (see pooling robustness in Buckland et al. 2001:41-42), we prioritized allowing heterogeneity in availability over perceptibility for abundance models.\nFor abundance models, we first considered two potential functions for describing the decline in perceptibility of birds with distance from the surveyor: a half-normal model and a hazard model. We preliminarily fitted detection-only versions of these models to the raw distance data (i.e., distances not indexed by sampling unit or year). We used the Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC; Watanabe 2010, Hooten and Hobbs 2015) to select the most parsimonious perceptibility functional form and then retained that function for each species for modeling distance-based perceptibility in the primary analysis. We first considered the maximally complex abundance model (hereafter global abundance model), which included annual variation in both perceptibility and availability, and variability in availability among Bird Conservation Regions (Equation D.20 - Equation D.22). If the global abundance model did not converge after a specified number of attempts (for details on model fitting, convergence, and MCMC sampling criteria, see Section D.1.7 below), we then considered a constant perceptibility abundance model, which replaced either Equation D.20 and Equation D.23 or Equation D.21 and Equation D.24 with\n\\[log(σ) \\sim Normal(4.5,1.5) \\tag{D.36}\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[log(h) \\sim Normal(4.5,1.5), \\tag{D.37}\\]\nrespectively. We successfully fitted models allowing variation in availability for all species, so we had no need of a constant availability model, even though we did initially consider it.\nFor occupancy models, we occasionally failed to achieve convergence when allowing detectability to vary among years and Bird Conservation Regions, in which case we fitted a constant-detectability model. Since detectability for occupancy models is analogous to the availability component in abundance models, the constant-detectability occupancy model replaces the equivalent of Equation D.22, Equation D.25, and Equation D.26 with\n\\[logit(p) \\sim Normal(0,1). \\tag{D.38}\\]\n\n\nModel fitting\nWe performed all data processing, analysis, and derivation of estimates in R (R Core Team, 2023) and model fitting in Nimble (de Valpine et al. 2017, 2023). All scripts for the annual analysis are maintained in a git repository and available upon request.\nThe R code automated combining strata-level population and trend estimates to derive superstrata estimates at multiple spatial scales, including quantification of estimation uncertainty. Additionally, we automated periodic checking of convergence and switching to alternative models in cases where more complex models failed to converge within a specified number of attempts.\nModel fitting with Nimble entailed sampling model parameter space with 2 independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains. For each species, the automated process began sampling with chains of length = 10000 iterations, discarding the first 5000 as burn-in and retaining every 50th sample, then checked convergence of chains using the \\(\\hat{R}\\) metric and effective sample size using \\(n_{effective}\\) (Gelman et al. 2004). We required \\(\\hat{R}&lt;1.1\\) and \\(n_{effective}\\geq 20\\), and continued sampling for another 10000 iterations until we either achieved these criteria or reached the maximum number of attempts, with an attempt being 10000 iterations and checks of \\(\\hat{R}\\) and \\(n_{effective}\\) occurring after each attempt. We specified 50 max attempts for global abundance and occupancy models and no max for simpler alternatives.",
